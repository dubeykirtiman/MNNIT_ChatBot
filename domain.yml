  utter_gesturecontrol:
  - text: "The objective of this project is to create a robot that can decrypt the gestures and move as we command through our gestures.This project is based on OpenCV and 
      hardware and also uses the concept of IoT for transmission of data.In this project, we take gestures from the camera, and the output is then transmitted to the Arduino UNO
     microcontroller over the wifi using Node MCU.Then as per the instructions of arduino, the bot performs motion.
     TECH STACK = Python , Arduino Programming , NodeMCU Programming
     Libraries to be installed/used
     1.) OpenCV
     2.) Mediapipe
     3.) URLlib Request
     4.) ESP8266 Library (In ArduinoIDE)"

However, the evil Decepticons have received intel about these transformer remains too! They have been incessantly trying to infiltrate the laboratory to disrupt the research and take hold of the remains for themselves. To ward off the troublesome Decepticons, the Lab In-charge wishes to automate the lab security system and give safe environment to the researchers. To this end, an Automatic Door and a Secure Locking System needs to be developed. He also wishes to keep track of the number of personnel inside the premises 24x7. The door should only be accessible once the correct password is entered (since Decepticons will easily fail the CAPTCHA Test).\n The door should open automatically on entering correct password. The people entering and leaving the premises through this door should be tracked at all times and counted. Do you have what it takes to protect our genius researchers from infiltrating Decepticon threat? Show your skills in DECEPT OF HOME and ensure safety of the laboratory and its employees!"

  # utter_Bot_Rush:
  # - text: "The Decepticons are new to earth and hence they do not remember any paths yet. 
  #      So  they use a very trivial technique to map the locations that they visit very often. Autobots just got you
  #      the information on their technique and now need your help in a very special mission. Decepticons draw 
  #      a maze of a straight black line and at the end of this maze they have all their major weapons facilities
  #     located,  so if someone keeps following the straight line and solves the maze then they can get to the
  #    Decepticons' weapons facilities. There is also debris in the path of lines. Your job is to build a 
  #    bot that can follow a straight line and reach the endpoint without deviating from the line or colliding 
  #    with any debris on the walls. Occasionally, the bot may need to follow the debris if it obstructs the line. 
  #    Can you pull off this task?

  #    BOT SPECIFICATION:-
  #     The bot must contain sufficient sensors to detect black lines and follow the wall.
  #     The bot must fit into a box of dimensions 25 cm x20 cm x20 cm.
  #     You are allowed to use readymade sensors. 
  #     You can’t supply more than 120W power to your robot.
  #     Each team is allowed to have only one autonomous bot.
  #     The bot should not communicate with any other devices.
  #     Data transfer violations will lead to disqualification.
  #     During the run, the autonomous bot must not damage the arena. 
  #     The robots can use on-board or off-board power supplies. 

  #    AREA SPECIFICATION:-
  #     Black lines of width 3cm on white background. 
  #     The maze may consist of dead ends. 
  #     There are two rectangles: 
  #             The first rectangle marks the start point of stage 1. 
  #             The second rectangle marks the end of stage 1.
  #     There will only be left, or right (90-degree) turns. 
  #         For Stage 1, there may be left, or right turns, dead ends, + crossings, and curved paths in the maze.
  #         For Stage 2, your bot should follow a wall on its right side (refer sample arena). 


  #    GAMEPLAY:-

  #     All the teams have to submit their robot for design testing.
  #     Your robot has to traverse the whole arena from start to end. 
  #     There are multiple checkpoints in the whole arena. 
  #     After clearing any checkpoint, if any timeout is required,
  #     the robot has to restart the last visited checkpoint. The maximum number of attempts is 3.

  #    EVENT FORMAT:-
  #    Bot Review & Preliminary Round: 
  #               Bot Review & Preliminary Round: The event coordinators would review the bots built to
  #               gauge the progress. The bot should be able to complete the first part of the arena. 

  #    Final Round: -
  #             Bots selected for the final round should be able to complete the whole arena.
  #    COMPONENTS: - 
  #    RULES AND REGULATIONS

  #     team can’t have members from different colleges.
  #     A team can have a maximum of 4 members and a minimum of 2 members.
  #     Judges’ decisions will be final and binding to all. 
  #     You will be provided with 220V 50 HZ AC supply. 
  #     You are allowed to use up to 12V to run the bot.
  #     Your Code should not be hard-coded. Organizers reserve the right to change any rules or make new changes. 
  #     Each team is allowed one trial run in both rounds to calibrate their
  #     sensors. No team is allowed to make changes in their code during or after the trial run.

  #    Stage 1: 
  #                 a. Clearing checkpoint 1 += 300 points
  #                 b. Clearing checkpoint 2 += 500 points 
  #                 c. Clearing checkpoint 3 += 600 points 
  #                 d. Time Factor: Max 600 points, allotted relatively to the performance of all the  
  #                   participants.

  #    Stage 2: 
  #               a. Same as stage 1.
  #               b. Reaching the end += 1000 points"

  utter_introselfbalancingbot:
  - text : "The aim of this project is to make an automated vehicle that balances itself without any outside help or support.This project is a rather complex one as it involves using PID Control and involuted programming. Self-balancing robots are unique among all others, just because of their ability to balance on a given fixed position. Even if the robot is displaced from its position, it is programmed so that it again recovers its position.
            \nTechnology used:\n
            On Robot: Bluetooth, PID, TIMER Interrupt, Kalman Filter, Communication protocol (serial and I2C).\n
            Features:\n
            1.The robot balances on two wheels.\n
            2.We can move the robot left, right, forward, and backward.\n
            3.Option to set the PID constants from the onboard knob as well as wirelessly from the Android application.\n
            4.The robot stands on its own with a servo motor for calibration when powered on.\n
            5.We can reset the robot wirelessly in case it falls on the ground.\n
            6.Used PORT control of Arduino for making the pin high and low as it is 60 times faster than the digitalWrite function of Arduino."

  - text : "MPU6050- MPU6050 is a three-axis accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope Micro Electro-mechanical system (MEMS). It aids in the measurement of velocity, orientation, acceleration, displacement, and other motion-related features.\n
            Arduino Uno- Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards, Arduino shields, and Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output.\n
            Drv8825 Motor driver- The Drv8825 is a complete micro-stepping motor driver with a built-in translator for easy operation. It is designed to operate bipolar stepper motors in full-, half-, quarter-, eighth-, and sixteenth-step modes, with an output drive capacity of up to 45 V and ±2.2 A.\n
            Stepper Motor- Stepper motors are a type of DC synchronous motor. Whereas the rotation of an induction motor is largely uncontrollable, the rotation of a stepper motor can be controlled with a remarkable degree of precision. Stepper motors can produce full, instantaneous torque - even from a standstill.\n
            Li-polymer battery- A lithium-polymer battery (LiPo) is a rechargeable battery that, in the case of true LiPo, uses solid polymer for the electrolyte and lithium for one of the electrodes. Commercially available LiPo is a hybrid- gel polymer or liquid electrolyte in a pouch format, more accurately termed a lithium-ion polymer battery.\n
            Jumper wires- Jumper wires typically come in three versions- male-to-male, male-to-female and female-to-female. The difference between each is in the endpoint of the wire. Male ends have a pin protruding and can plug into things, while female ends do not and are used to plug things into.\n
            \nRole of each software component-\n
            MPU6050 Data: Initially MPU-6050 will measure the angle difference between the current position of the bot and its normal position. Now, this data is transferred to PID.\n
            PID Tuning: PID will take input from MPU-6050 and accordingly calculate the PID value and give variable signals to both motors using interrupt service routine to bring the bot to its normal position and balance it.\n
            Bluetooth Communication: Once the bot is balanced then we will send different commands ( forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and stop ) to the bot using Bluetooth communication to move the bot in different directions.\n
            ISR Command: After receiving a command from Bluetooth, ISR will give different impulses to motors to move the bot according to the given command."

  - text: "A music genre classifier is a software program that predicts the genre of a piece of music in audio format. These devices are used for tasks such as automatically tagging music for distributors such as Spotify and Billboard and determining appropriate background music for events.\n\n
          The ambiguity of genre classification makes machine intelligence well-suited to this task. Given enough audio data, of which large amounts can be easily harvested from freely available music online, machine learning can observe and make predictions using these ill-defined patterns.\n\n
          The goal of this project is to build a proof-of-concept music genre classifier using a deep learning approach that can correctly predict the genre and confidence level of Western music from popular candidate genres (classical, jazz, rap, rock, etc.. ).\n
          Approach/Workplan: \n
          1.Research:\n
          Audio is a non-semantic symbolic representation and an unstructured binary stream. Because the audio itself lacks the description of content semantics and structured organization, it brings great difficulty to the audio classification work.\n 
          As audio is still a topic of research therefore the first step will be exploring the dynamics of the problem of the classification of audio files. Preparing a basic roadmap for the Model training/ preparation.\n
          2.	Model Training and Testing:\n
          The heart of the project is preparing a Model for the genre classification and it will take the most amount of time. This step will majorly include writing the notebook, preparing a proper pipeline, and evaluating appropriate statistical models and neural networks to train the model. The choice of good open-source datasets for training is also crucial. Testing the model and evaluating it against established metrics.\n
          3.Deployment:\n
          It is the most critical step that must be completed for a model to serve its intended purpose and solve the challenges it is designed for. \n
          We intend to deploy it as a free web application using web frameworks like Django and Flask."

           Real-life applications -\n
           1.Medicine: Doctors and nurses have to keep a large number of detailed records of interactions with patients, treatment plans, prescriptions, and more. With dictation services, they can verbally detail this information and have it automatically transcribed for greater efficiency.\n
           2.Social Media: If you’ve looked at Instagram or YouTube lately, you may have noticed some videos have captioning services. This is a new feature that autocaptions people as they speak using AI. While it may not always be fully accurate, it’s helping to provide greater accessibility and usability for users.\n
           3.Technology: Smartphones have had the talk-to-text feature in place for some time. As the name suggests, it lets you text someone through audio dictation rather than typing out the message.\n
           4.Law: In law, accurate documentation of court proceedings is fundamental to a case because accuracy can affect the outcome of that case. It’s also important for historical documentation to learn from or reference for future cases.\n
           5.Police Work: Audio transcription has numerous applications in police work, with likely more to come. It can be used for transcribing investigative interviews, evidence records, calls to the emergency line, body camera recorded interactions, and more. Much like with the law, the accuracy of these transcriptions can have a significant impact on court cases and people’s lives."

  - text: "In the code the step of processing is as follows :
         1.) We first Set the basic set of values for the pi camera such as resolution , framerate and use PiRGBArray to capture it in store in an array .
          2.) We then ask the user for setting the hsv values for the ball they want the ball to follow.
         3.) Now the contour is formed from the given hsv values, High definition of the contour assures accurate detection and smooth run of the bot.
         4.) So for the user input we are creating trackbars with min and max values for the hsv so as to adjust the contour we obtain in the Mask frame.
         5.) Through this we are applying the fliter over the input for the required input.
         6.) After applying we are implementing the serial connection between the raspberry pi and arduino uno through the /dev/ttyACM0 port with band rate of 9600.
         7.) We then run a loop for the frame in the camera.capture_continuous function that takes format of input and the use_video_port if availiable with the captures."

        Optimus Prime, representing humans, has accepted these terms as the best possible solution. Victory in the race will ensure that the Decepticons end their tyranny and vacate Earth.
        To achieve this, Optimus Prime requires the best engineers to develop an advanced manual bot that can be controlled using a mobile phone. The bot will compete against Wheelie, the bot developed by the Decepticons for the race. However, before entering the final race against Wheelie, engineers must prove their worth and be the best among their peers. They must navigate an arena or path with enough twists and turns to test the bot's speed, handling, and agility, completing it in the shortest possible time. The bot should not move out of the arena or collide with any obstacles, or points will be deducted.
